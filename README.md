# Stock_Analysis

This script is for a Shiny application that analyzes stock data. The user interface of the application has a sidebar with options for the user to select what type of analysis they want to perform, and the main panel displays a plot of the data.

The server logic calculates different types of analysis based on the user's selections. These analyses include Bollinger Bands, Confidence and Prediction Interval, and Market Prediction. The Bollinger Bands are calculated using the moving average and standard deviation of the stock data, the Confidence and Prediction Interval are calculated using a linear regression model, and the Market Prediction is performed using ARIMA modeling.
